# 02-Laravel-Faker

This web application is made in Laravel. In this small application, the Faker library was used to insert data, i.e. users and posts. Tinker was used to inject the data. The model used belongsTo, hasMany relations. Materialize (CSS) framework is used for the layout of the pages. At the bottom of the page, the last three postings are displayed. It is possible to view the user as well as all his posts.

In the application created by the faker, it is possible to change the user and post information, as well as delete the user, where all his posts will be automatically deleted.

-Tinker allows you to interact with your entire Laravel application on the command line, including your Eloquent models, jobs, events, and more. To enter the Tinker environment, run the tinker Artisan command: php artisan tinker.
